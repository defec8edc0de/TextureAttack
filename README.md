# TextureAttack
A java program to attack watermarks in DDS textures.

1. You open your DDS textures
2. You select a selection algorithm that finds background pixels in the texture
3. You select an attack algorithm
4. Attack the textures
5. Save the attacked textures

This project aimed to evaluate a watermarking algorithm developed at Fraunhofer SIT.
I developed the program during a multimedia security internship at Fraunhofer SIT.
And basically my attack successfully broke the watermark (less than 50% reconstrucutable) in the textures.
